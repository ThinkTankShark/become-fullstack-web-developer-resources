# Learning How to Learn

I suppose you decided to follow your dream or change your career path a bit if you are still
reading this!!! Reading a new topic could be rather challenging but most definitely
rewarding at the end. I DO recommend watching this ​free course​ - learning how to learn.

# Getting the Basics

Here's the basics you need to learn:
● HTML & CSS
● Responsive Designs
● JavaScript
● Git
Now once you are a master of the topics above (And I mean really know it inside out) then
continue your learning path with these:
● Frontend Development:
○ CSS Preprocessors (Less, Sass & PostCSS)
○ ReactJS (It's my favorite but feel free to learn AngularJS too if you want)
○ AngularJS
○ Task Runners
● Backend Development:
○ Database
